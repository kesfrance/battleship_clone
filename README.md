# battleship_clone
A clone I made for the battleship game using objected oriented programming in Python.

We played at home and was an interesting game with family.

This game shoud be played via the commandline by two players. 

To play the game, simply clone the files into a folder.

Make sure you have python3 installed.

Then type the following to get started.

    python3 battleship.y
